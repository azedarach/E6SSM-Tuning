With the discovery of a 125 GeV Standard Model (SM) like Higgs boson
and rising lower bounds on the masses of superpartners, minimal models
of low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) appear to be increasingly fine
tuned. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) large stop
masses, needed to obtain the observed Higgs mass, give a significant
contribution to fine tuning. $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM that solve
the $\mu$-problem have new F- and D-term contributions to the Higgs mass,
allowing a 125 GeV Higgs with lighter stops and so alleviating the
associated fine tuning. However, it was recently demonstrated, within
a constrained version of the Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard Model (E$_6$SSM)
defined at the Grand Unification (GUT) scale, that the presence of a massive $Z'$ boson introduces a 
substantial new source of tuning in these theories at tree level. Here we
consider the impact of this tuning when we remove the fine tuning that depends
on assumptions about the SUSY breaking scale, by setting the SUSY
breaking parameters at low energies. We find that the existing
experimental bounds on the $Z'$ mass impose an effective lower bound on
the fine tuning, which does not depend on assumptions about SUSY breaking. 
We compare our results against the tuning in the MSSM with the SUSY breaking terms also defined at low energies.

\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}
The discovery of an approximately 125 GeV Higgs
\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} at the large hadron collider
(LHC) has interesting implications for physics beyond the standard
model (SM) and supersymmetry (SUSY).  On the one hand it provides a
light Higgs boson in fitting with expectations from supersymmetry, and
can be fitted in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).  On
the other hand it is slightly heavier than the constrained version of the 
MSSM (cMSSM) can accommodate naturally \cite{Cassel:2011zd,Ghilencea:2012gz}.

The Higgs causes a naturalness problem because at tree level it has an
upper bound of the mass of the $Z$ boson, $M_Z$. The dominant higher
order corrections to the Higgs mass come from stops and to obtain a
$125$ GeV Higgs they need be rather heavy. Heavy stops will provide a
large contribution to the soft breaking mass for the up-type Higgs
scalar, $m_{H_u}^2$ at low energies, through the evolution of the
renormalisation group equations (RGEs) from the grand unification
(GUT) scale to the electroweak (EW) scale. This affects the SUSY
prediction of the electroweak VEV, $v$, or $M_Z$.  This naturalness
problem motivates both further examination of non-minimal SUSY models
that can raise the Higgs mass without the need for heavy stops and
alternative possibilities for how the soft breaking parameters get
generated, which might set them them at lower energies, reducing the
influence the stops have on the soft breaking mass for the up-type
Higgs scalar, $m_{H_u}^2$.

In addition to that naturalness issue, often referred to as the little
hierarchy problem, the MSSM also suffers from the $\mu$-problem. This
is also a naturalness problem since there should be a natural explanation
of how the $\mu$ superpotential parameter can be set to the same scale
as the soft breaking masses.

U(1) extensions of the MSSM provide a very elegant solution to this
$\mu$-problem \cite{Fayet:1977yc, Kim:1983dt, Suematsu:1994qm, Cvetic:1995rj,  Cvetic:1996mf, Jain:1995cb, Nir:1995bu, Cvetic:1997ky} and also
raise the Higgs mass with new $F$- and $D$-terms. Nonetheless, as was
recently demonstrated in the context of the exceptional supersymmetric
standard model (E$_6$SSM)
\cite{King:2005jy,King:2005my,Athron:2010zz}, such models can still suffer from
naturalness problems with the mass of the new $Z^\prime$ associated
with break down of the new U(1) appearing in the electroweak symmetry
breaking conditions at tree level \cite{Athron:2013ipa}.  Nonetheless
the constrained version of E$_6$SSM (cE$_6$SSM) \cite{Athron:2009ue,
  Athron:2009bs} still turned out to be significantly less tuned than
the cMSSM.

However this comparison of fine tuning depends crucially upon the
assumptions of these gravity mediated SUSY breaking motivated
constrained models and in particular the way the universality
constraints are applied at the GUT scale.  As mentioned above, given
the findings at the LHC it is worth considering other possibilities,
which may allow the soft masses to be set at lower energies. As the
scale at which the parameters fulfill some breaking inspired
constraints is lowered the stop masses contribute less to the fine
tuning.

At the same time in U(1) extensions, lowering the UV boundary scale
for the RGE evolution also allows even larger $F$-term contributions
to the Higgs mass, so long as one only requires $\lambda$, the
coupling between the Singlet Higgs, $S$ and the up- and down-type
Higgs bosons, $H_u$ and $H_d$, to remain perturbative up to the UV scale
and not the all the way up to the GUT scale. 

However the tuning from the $Z^\prime$ mass limit does not disappear
as the UV boundary condition is lowered. This tuning appears in the
EWSB conditions at tree level and is quite difficult to avoid without
introducing a pure gauge singlet \cite{Athron:2014pua}.



In this paper we investigate how big this tuning is if we bring this
scale all the way down to 20 TeV, effectively minimising contribution
from the stops. We find that the $Z^\prime$ limit is enough to already
require moderate fine tuning.  We also show this is comparable to the
situation in the MSSM defined at the same scale if chargino limit is
$700$ GeV, which is the most conservative limit on can obtain and
above the tuning from the stops, in both the MSSM and U(1) extensions.
We also show that the tuning from the stops becomes larger when the
high scale is raised to ?? whereas for the E$_6$SSM the minimum tuning
is lower than the MSSM above this scale.  Therefore it is clear that
which model is preferred and how large the tuning is depends on our
assumptions about SUSY breaking models.

However we also show that if the $Z^\prime$ limit is the extended to
?? then $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM will already suffer from a
severe tuning, irrespective of the UV boundary condition for the RGE
evolution.  Therefore the $Z^\prime$ constraint is amongst the most
important in terms of tuning and attacking natural supersymmetry
experimentally and the next run of the LHC will be crucial.



Here we will refer to U(1) extensions of the MSSM, which solve the
$\mu$-problem as the USSM
\cite{Cvetic:1995rj, Jain:1995cb, Nir:1995bu, Cvetic:1996mf, Cvetic:1997ky}, while we will
sometimes specify that the models are inspired by $E_6$ by referring
to them as such. Finally we will also discuss specific models with
complete $E_6$ matter multiplets at low energies and an extra $U(1)$
under which the right handed neutrino remains interaction-less as
E$_6$SSM-variants\cite{Howl:2007zi, Braam:2009fi, Braam:2010sy, Hall:2011zq, Nevzorov:2012hs, Athron:2014pua}, with the E$_6$SSM reserved for the original
formulation of this model \cite{King:2005jy,King:2005my,Athron:2010zz}
original formulation of the model.
 
$U(1)$ and $E_6$ inspired extensions of the MSSM have been studied
very widely in the literature \cite{Gunion:1989we, Gunion:1992hs,
  Binetruy:1985xm, Ellis:1986yg, Ibanez:1986si, Gunion:1986ky,
  Haber:1986gz, Baer:1987eb, Gunion:1987jd, Grifols:1986vr,
  Ellis:1986ip, Morris:1987fm, Drees:1987tp, Ma:1995xk,
  Suematsu:1997tv, Suematsu:1997qt, Suematsu:1997au, Keith:1996fv,
  Keith:1997zb, Gherghetta:1996yr, Demir:1998dk, Langacker:1998tc,
  Hambye:2000bn, Ma:2000jf} (or for reviews see
\cite{Hewett:1988xc,Langacker:2008yv}).  There has also been a lot of
work recently including investigations of the neutralino sector
\cite{Hesselbach:2001ri, Barger:2005hb, Choi:2006fz,
  Barger:2007nv};the relic abundance of dark matter
\cite{Kalinowski:2008iq}; GUT scale family symmetries which can
explain the hierarchy of masses in the fermion sector and their
associated mixings \cite{Stech:2008wd}; neurtrino physics
\cite{Kang:2004ix}; explanations of the matter-anti-matter asymmetry
of the universe though EW baryogensis or leptogensis
\cite{Hambye:2000bn,Ma:2000jf,Kang:2004pp}; dipole moments
\cite{GutierrezRodriguez:2006hb}; anomaly mediated SUSY breaking with
D-term contributions \cite{Asano:2008ju} and the (extended) Higgs
sectors \cite{Daikoku:2000ep,Ham:2008xf}.


In this paper we will often focus on a very well motivated $E_6$
inspired $U(1)$ extension, the Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard
Model (E$_6$SSM)\cite{King:2005jy,King:2005my,Athron:2010zz}.  In this
model since the right handed neutrino remains interaction-less they may
explain the tiny observed masses of neutrinos via the see-saw
mechanism and the baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis
\cite{Hambye:2000bn,King:2008qb, King:2008gw}.  Recently it has also been studied in the context of electroweak baryogenesis \cite{Chao:2014hya}.

The gauge coupling running in the E$_6$SSM at the two-loop level leads
to unification more precisely than in the MSSM \cite{King:2007uj} or
in slightly modified scenarios two-step unification can take place
\cite{Howl:2007hq,Howl:2007zi}. If the exotic particles are light in
these models this can open up non-standard decays of the SM--like
Higgs boson \cite{Hall:2010ix,Nevzorov:2013tta,Athron:2014pua}. The
correct relic abundance could be obtained entirely through an almost
decoupled ``inert'' neutralino sector \cite{Hall:2009aj},.  However
this is no longer phenomenologically viable due to limits from
direct detection of dark matter
\cite{2011PhRvL.107m1302A,2012PhRvL.109r1301A, Akerib:2013tjd} and due
to a significant suppression of the decay of the lightest Higgs boson
into SM states, due to a new channel into inert singlinos opening up.

There are still several remaining options. One may specialize to
scenarios known as the EZSSM \cite{Hall:2011zq} where the inert
singlinos, which cause these problems are entirely decoupled and the
relic abundance is fitted with a bino-like candidate with a novel
mechanism involving back-scattering into a Heavier inert
Higgsino. Another well motivated scenario admits two possible dark
matter candidates \cite{Nevzorov:2012hs}, where one will be an inert
singlino and the other will have a similar composition to MSSM
neutralinos. The simplest phenomenologically viable solution in that
case is to make the singlinos extremely light hot dark matter
candidate and explains almost all the relic abundance density with

The impact of gauge kinetic
mixing in the case where both of the extra U(1)'s appearing from the
breakdown of E$_6$ are present at low energy was studied in
\cite{Rizzo:2012rf}.  The E$_6$SSM was also included in a studies looking
at how first or second generation sfermion masses can be used to
constrain the GUT scale parameters \cite{Miller:2012vn} and the
renormalization of VEVs \cite{Sperling:2013eva, Sperling:2013xqa}.
The particle spectrum and  collider signatures of constrained version of the E$_6$SSM have been studied in a series of papers,
\cite{Athron:2009ue,Athron:2009bs,Athron:2011wu,Athron:2012sq}. The threshold
corrections to the $\overline{DR}$ gauge and Yukawa couplings in the
E$_6$SSM were calculated and the numerical impact in the constrained
version examined \cite{Athron:2012pw}. 

As mentioned earlier the fine tuning of the cE$_6$SSM was recently studied
\cite{Athron:2013ipa} and there it was revealed that the associated
$Z^\prime$ boson leads to a new source of fine tuning since it's mass
appears in the EWSB conditions.  

In this paper we will examine this source of fine tuning in more detail by considering low energy constructions where the usual fine tuning problem from the Higgs is minimised.   We will also consider  alternate charges for the extra $U(1)$ symmetry to relax the focus on the E$_6$SSM and demonstrate that this is quite a generic result.

To quantify the fine tuning we will employ the traditional
Barbieri-Giudice measure \cite{Ellis:1986yg,Barbieri:1987fn}.  This has
been used extensively within the literature
e.g. \cite{deCarlos:1993yy, deCarlos:1993ca, Chankowski:1997zh, Agashe:1997kn, Wright:1998mk, Kane:1998im, BasteroGil:1999gu, Feng:1999zg, Allanach:2000ii, Dermisek:2005ar, Barbieri:2005kf, Allanach:2006jc, Gripaios:2006nn, Dermisek:2006py, Barbieri:2006dq, Kobayashi:2006fh, Perelstein:2012qg, Antusch:2012gv,Cheng:2012pe, CahillRowley:2012rv, Ross:2012nr, Basak:2012bd, Kang:2012sy, Athron:2013ipa,Miller:2013jra, Binjonaid:2014oga, Miller:2014jza}.

A number of alternative measures have also been applied in the
literature \cite{Anderson:1994dz, Anderson:1994tr,
  Anderson:1995cp,Anderson:1996ew,Ciafaloni:1996zh,Chan:1997bi,
  Barbieri:1998uv,
  Giusti:1998gz,Casas:2003jx,Casas:2004uu,Casas:2004gh,Casas:2006bd,Kitano:2005wc,
  Athron:2007ry, Athron:2007qr, Baer:2012up} with varying motivations.
A very different approach is to work within a Bayesian analysis.
There the concept of naturalness is automatically incorporated since
in models where one must fine tune parameters to fit measured values
of the observables, the region with high likelihood will occupy a tiny
prior volume \cite{Allanach:2007qk, Cabrera:2008tj, Ghilencea:2012gz,
  Ghilencea:2012qk, Fichet:2012sn, Kim:2013uxa} suppressing the
posterior.  Indeed in the MSSM and NMSSM if one transforms GUT scale
parameters to the VEVs, the inverse of the Jacobian for this
transformation looks quite like the derivatives that appear in the
traditional fine tuning measure \cite{Allanach:2007qk, Cabrera:2008tj,
  Kim:2013uxa}.  If one thinks more generally then a model without
fine tuning is one where the parametrisation is such that all the
parameters are observables \cite{Fichet:2012sn, Kim:2013uxa}.  This
provides a quite general definition of fine tuning as $1/|J|$ where
$|J|$ is the determinant of the Jacobian for the co-ordinate
transformation between the parameters and the
observables. Interestingly this means the tuning is the ratio of the
infinitesimal observable space space volume element to the
infinitesimal parameter space element and coincides with the measure
proposed in \cite{Athron:2007ry} when the interval of variation is
taken to zero.

While this approach has many merits here will employ the traditional
measure of fine tuning because it is both simple to apply and easy to
compare with previous results due to it's widespread use.  Fortunately
the derivatives which appear in these tuning are also similar to the
Bayesian motivated measure so there should not be too large a discrepancy between the two approaches.


The structure of this paper is as follows.  In section \ref{sec:model} we review the models we consider.  In section \ref{sec:ewsb} we specify the EWSB conditions of the models, with particular focus on how the $Z^\prime$ mass influences the prediction of $M_Z$.  Then in section \ref{sec:tuning} we introduce our fine tuning measure and our approach to evaluating it to obtain the individual sensitivities.  The numerical procedure we use to obtain our results is given in \ref{subsec:numericalprocedure} and then the results are specified in section \ref{sec:results}. 





 

\section{\label{sec:model}U(1) extensions and the E$_6$SSM}
In this paper we consider U(1) extensions of the MSSM where the gauge group at low energies is,
 \be
SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times U(1)^\prime, \ee 
where $U(1)^\prime$ is the new gauge group beyond that of the SM and MSSM. The minimal superfield content of $U(1)$ extensions which solve the $\mu$-problem should be ordinary left handed quark, $\hat{Q}_i$ and lepton $\hat{L}_i$ ($i=1,2,3$)superfields along with right handed superfields $\hat{u}^c_i$, $\hat{d}^c_i$,  $\hat{e}^c_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) for the up-type (s)quarks, down-type (s)quarks and charged (s)leptons respectively and three Higgs superfields, up-type $\hat{H}_u$, down-type $\hat{H}_d$ and a singlet under the SM gauge group $\hat{S}$.

  The couplings for the $U(1)^\prime$ gauge group should allow the following renormalisable superpotential terms required in the USSM,
\be
W_{USSM} =  y^U_{ij} \hat{u}^c_i \hat{H}_u \hat{Q}_j + y^D_{ij} \hat{d}^c_i \hat{H}_d \hat{Q}_j + y^E_{ij} \hat{e}^c_i \hat{H}_d \hat{L}_j + \lambda \hat{S} \hat{H}_d \hat{H}_u,
\ee with $i,j \in \{1,2,3\}$.  


The $U(1)^\prime$ charges should allow for cancellations of gauge
anomalies. The most elegant way to do this is to use an extra $U(1)$
gauge symmetry that can be obtained from the break down of the $E_6$
gauge symmetry which is anomaly free and have all matter multiplets
from the $Z7$-plet representation of $E_6$ survive down to low energies.

The breaking of $E_6$ into $SO(10)$, gives rise to $E_6\to
SO(10)\times U(1)_{\psi}$, and the subsequent breaking of $SO(10)$
into $SU(5)$, gives $SO(10)\to SU(5)\times U(1)_{\chi}$ (this is
reviewed in e.g.~\cite{Langacker:2008yv}). The extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetry at low energies should then be a linear combination of these in the $E_6$ inspired case,
\be
U(1)^\prime = \cos(\theta) U(1)_{\chi} + \sin(\theta) U(1)_{\psi}.
\ee In table \ref{tab:E6charges} the charges for several popular $E_6$ inspired $U(1)$ extensions are shown.

\label{tab:E6charges}
\end{table}

To ensure anomaly cancellation in these cases the full matter content
from three generations of $27$-plets should survive to low energies.
the low energy matter content would then be extended to, \be
(\hat{Q}_i,\,\hat{u}^c_i,\,\hat{d}^c_i,\,\hat{L}_i,\,\hat{e}^c_i)
+(\hat{D}_i,\,\hat{\overline{D}}_i)+(\hat{S}_{i})+(\hat{H}^u_i)+(\hat{H}^d_i),\ee
where the $\hat{S}_{i}$, $\hat{H}^u_i$ and $\hat{H}^d_i$ are three
generations of doublets, whose quantum numbers will be like the
singlet, and up-, down-type Higgs fields and the $\hat{D}_i$ and
$\hat{\overline{D}}_i$ being $SU(3)_C$ triplets that reside in the same $SU(5)$
multiplets as these Higgs-like states.

If one wishes to maintain gauge coupling unification this set of
states should be augmented by two extra $SU(2)$ doublet states
$H^\prime$ and $\overline{H}^\prime$ belonging to other $27^\prime$
and $\overline{27}^\prime$ multiplets that must be incomplete at low
energies.

The full superpotential for $E_6$ inspired models will then be,

\be
W_{E6} = W_0 + W_1 + W_2,
\label{Eq:e6-superpot}
\ee where
\begin{eqnarray}
W_0 &=& \lambda_{ijk} \hat{S}_i \hat{H}^d_{j} \hat{H}^u_{k} + \kappa_{ijk} \hat{S}_i \hat{D}_j \hat{\bar{D}}_k + h^N_{ijk} \hat{N}^c_i \hat{H}^u_{j} \hat{L}_k \nonumber \\
& & + h^U_{ijk} \hat{u}^c_i \hat{H}^u_{j} \hat{Q}_k + h^D_{ijk} \hat{d}^c_i \hat{H}^d_{j} \hat{Q}_k + h^E_{ijk} \hat{e}^c_i \hat{H}^d_{j} \hat{L}_k, \\
W_1 &=& g^Q_{ijk} \hat{D}_i \hat{Q}_j \hat{Q}_k + g^q_{ijk} \hat{\bar{D}}_i \hat{d}^c_j \hat{u}^c_k, \\
W_2 &=& g^N_{ijk} \hat{N}^c_i \hat{D}_j \hat{d}^c_k + g^E_{ijk} \hat{e}^c_i \hat{D}_j \hat{u}^c_k + g^D_{ijk} \hat{Q}_i \hat{L}_j \hat{\bar{D}}_k.

Nonetheless while this model is very elegant so far, the  superpotential, (\ref{Eq:e6-superpot}) contains dangerous terms which can induce proton decay and lead to large flavour changing neutral currents (FCNCs).  There are a number of approaches to suppress these terms, involving the use of different discrete symmetries.  Here for the purposes of renormalisation group running we will simply include the following unsuppressed superpotential terms, which follows the approach taking in work on the cE$_6$SSM \cite{Athron:2009ue, Athron:2009bs},

V_{E_6}^F&=\lambda^2|S|^2(|H_1|^2+|H_2|^2)+\lambda^2|(H_1\cdot H_2)|^2,\label{eq:E6VFterms}\\
V_{E_6}^D&=\frac{\bar{g}^2}{8}\left ( |H_2|^2-|H_1|^2\right )^2+\frac{g_2^2}{2}|H_1^\dagger H_2|^2+\frac{g_1'^2}{2}(\tilde{Q}_1|H_1|^2+\tilde{Q}_2|H_2|^2+\tilde{Q}_S|S|^2)^2,\label{eq:E6VDterms}\\
V_{E_6}^{\textrm{soft}}&=m_S^2|S|^2+m_{H_d}^2|H_1|^2+m_{H_u}^2|H_2|^2+\Big [\lambda A_\lambda S(H_1\cdot H_2)+\textrm{h.c.}\Big ].\label{eq:E6Vsoft}
\end{align}
In these expressions $g_2$, $g'=\sqrt{3/5}g_1$, and $g_1'$ are the $SU(2)$, (non-GUT normalized) $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)'$ gauge couplings, respectively, and $\bar{g}^2=g_2^2+g'^2$. The charges $\tilde{Q}_1$, $\tilde{Q}_2$ and $\tilde{Q}_S$ are effective $U(1)'$ charges for $H_1$, $H_2$ and $S$, respectively. Note that the $SU(2)$ dot product is defined by $A\cdot B\equiv \epsilon_{\alpha\beta}A^\alpha B^\beta=A^2B^1-A^1B^2$. The term $\Delta V_{E_6}$ contains the Coleman-Weinberg contributions to the effective potential. In the case of the $U(1)_\chi$ model, $V_{E_6}^F$ may also contain an elementary $\mu$ term contribution, as occurs in the MSSM.\\ \\
Demanding that the Higgs fields $H_1$, $H_2$ and the singlet $S$ acquire real VEVs of the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6vevs}
\langle H_1 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \; \langle H_2 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}, \; \langle S \rangle =\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
at the physical minimum leads to the minimization conditions
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:E6EWSBConditions}
\begin{align}
&f_1=m_{H_d}^2v_1+\frac{\lambda^2}{2}(v_2^2+s^2)v_1-\frac{\lambda A_\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}sv_2-\frac{\bar{g}^2}{8}
(v_2^2-v_1^2)v_1+D_{H_d}v_1+\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_1}=0,\label{eq:E6EWSBcondition1} \\
&f_2=m_{H_u}^2v_2+\frac{\lambda^2}{2}(v_1^2+s^2)v_2-\frac{\lambda A_\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}sv_1+\frac{\bar{g}^2}{8}
(v_2^2-v_1^2)v_2+D_{H_u}v_2+\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_2}=0,\label{eq:E6EWSBcondition2} \\
&f_3=m_S^2s+\frac{\lambda^2}{2}(v_2^2+v_1^2)s-\frac{\lambda A_\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}v_2v_1+D_Ss+\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial s}=0.\label{eq:E6EWSBcondition3}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The quantities $D_{H_1}$, $D_{H_2}$ and $D_S$ appearing above are $U(1)'$ $D$-term contributions that are absent in the MSSM and NMSSM and are given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6Dterms}
D_\phi\equiv \frac{g_1'^2}{2}\left ( \tilde{Q}_1v_1^2+\tilde{Q}_2v_2^2+\tilde{Q}_Ss^2\right )\tilde{Q}_\phi.
\end{equation}
As was noted in \cite{Athron:2013ipa}, the first two of these conditions may be rewritten in the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6MZequation}
\frac{M_Z^2}{2}=-\frac{\lambda^2s^2}{2}+\frac{\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2-\tilde{m}_{H_u}^2\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1}+\frac{D_{H_d}-D_{H_u}\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6sin2bequation}
\sin 2\beta=\frac{\sqrt{2}\lambda A_{\lambda} s}{\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2+\tilde{m}_{H_u}^2+\lambda^2s^2+D_{H_d}+D_{H_u}},
\end{equation}
with $M_Z^2=\bar{g}^2v^2/4$, $v^2=v_1^2+v_2^2$ and $\tan\beta = v_2/v_1$ and where we have for convenience absorbed the effects of the loop corrections into the soft masses, 
\begin{align*}
\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2&=m_{H_d}^2+\frac{1}{v_1}\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_1},\\
\tilde{m}_{H_u}^2&=m_{H_u}^2+\frac{1}{v_2}\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_2}.
\end{align*}
Written in the form of Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}) we see the potential new source of fine tuning alluded to above, in the form of the third term on the right-hand side. For large values of the VEV $s$, the $D$-term contributions can be quite a bit larger than $M_Z^2$. In particular, recent experimental limits \cite{Aad:2014cka} require that the $Z'$ mass be large, with bounds of $M_{Z'}\gtrsim 2.51$ TeV in $U(1)_\psi$ models and $M_{Z'}\gtrsim 2.62$ TeV in $U(1)_\chi$ models. To satisfy these limits typically requires large values of the singlet VEV $s$. For example $s\gtrsim 6$ TeV is required in the E$_6$SSM with $U(1)'=U(1)_N$, so that $|D_{H_u}|,|D_{H_d}|\gg M_Z^2$ for $E_6$ models with $\tilde{Q}_S\neq 0$. As a result the remaining terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}) must be tuned to cancel the resulting very large contribution to $M_Z$. Moreover, because this is a large \textit{tree level} fine tuning, it may negate the increase in naturalness that is associated with having a reduced need for heavy superpartners.

\subsection{\label{subsec:tuningmeasure}The Fine Tuning Measure}
As stated above, in order to quantify the resulting fine tuning we apply the traditional Ellis-Barbieri-Giudice measure \cite{Ellis:1986yg,Barbieri:1987fn}. A specific model is characterised by a set of $n$ model parameters $\{p_i\}$ and is defined at some input scale $M_X$. For a given parameter $p$ in this set, one computes an associated sensitivity coefficient \cite{Feng:2013pwa}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bgmeasure}
\Delta_p=\left | \frac{\partial \log M_Z^2}{\partial \log p}\right |=\left | \frac{p}{M_Z^2}\frac{\partial M_Z^2}{\partial p}\right |,
\end{equation}
where $M_Z^2=\bar{g}^2v^2/4$. The coefficient $\Delta_p$ measures the fractional variation in $M_Z^2$ resulting from a given variation in the parameter $p$. The overall fine tuning is then taken to be $\Delta = \underset{i}{\max}\,\{\Delta_{p_i}\}$.\\ \\

The sensitivity coefficients $\Delta_p$ may be calculated directly from the expression for $M_Z^2$ in terms of the $p_i$ for a particular model, which leads to a so-called master formula for calculating the fine tuning. A master formula for the E$_6$SSM, obtained from the tree level scalar potential, was presented in \cite{Athron:2013ipa}. In order to derive the expression presented there, the fact that $s \gg v$ was made use of to neglect certain $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ terms in the EWSB conditions, greatly simplifying the final result.
% Important question:
% Impact of varying charges, is it picked up by the approximate CE6SSM master formula?
% e.g. how different are things in the limit Q_S --> 0?
For the purposes of exploring a wider class of $E_6$ inspired models, we have derived the master formula without neglecting any $\mathcal{O}(v^2)$ terms. The more complete tree-level master formula is somewhat complicated. This is because, unlike in the MSSM, even at tree level it is not possible to solve explicitly for the VEVs $v_1$, $v_2$ in terms of the Lagrangian parameters. It may be written in the form
\be
\Delta_p=|C|^{-1}\times \frac{|p|}{M_Z}\bigg|\sum_{q}\tilde{\Delta}_q\frac{\partial q}{\partial p}\bigg|,
\label{eq:E6masterformula}
\ee
where the sum is over all low energy running parameters appearing in the tree level EWSB conditions, i.e. $q\in\{\lambda, A_\lambda, m_{H_d}^2,m_{H_u}^2,m_S^2,g_1,g_2,g_1'\}$. Explicit expressions for the function $C$ and the $\tilde{\Delta}_q$ appearing above are given in Appendix \ref{app:masterformula}. It should be noted that the effects of $U(1)$ mixing are neglected in deriving Eq. (\ref{eq:E6masterformula}).\\ \\
Evaluating the fine tuning directly using a master formula approach rapidly becomes impractical, as a brief inspection of the expressions for the $\tilde{\Delta}_i$ should make clear. It is well known in the MSSM that radiative corrections can significantly change (indeed, reduce) the fine tuning \cite{Cassel:2010px}. It is therefore important when studying the fine tuning to include 1- and 2-loop corrections in the fine tuning measure. To do so it is most convenient to work in terms of the EWSB conditions Eq. (\ref{eq:E6EWSBConditions}), rather than Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}). The general procedure is as follows \cite{Ellwanger:2011mu}. For a model in which $m$ fields develop real VEVs (e.g. $m=2$ in the MSSM, $m=3$ in the NMSSM and in the $E_6$ models considered), we require that the $m$ minimization conditions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EWSBconditions}
f_1=f_2=\dotsb=f_m=0
\end{equation}
continue to hold under an arbitrary variation in a model parameter $p\rightarrow p+\delta p$, so that the variations $\delta f_i$ satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EWSBvariations}
\delta f_1 = \delta f_2=\dotsb =\delta f_m =0.
\end{equation}
Each $f_i$ is a function of the VEVs $v_j$ and $l$ running parameters $q_k$ evaluated at the scale of EWSB, $f_i=f_i(v_j,q_k)$. Thus for each $f_i$ we have that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EWSBchainrule}
\delta f_i = \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial v_j}\frac{\partial v_j}{\partial p}+\sum_{k=1}^l \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial q_k}\frac{\partial q_k}{\partial p}=0.
\end{equation}
The quantities $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial v_j}$ are the elements of the CP-even Higgs squared mass matrix $M_h^2$ of the model before rotating into the mass eigenstate basis. When evaluated for all $n$ model parameters, the above system of equations can be concisely expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tuningsystem}
M_h^2\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial v_m}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial v_m}{\partial p_n}
\end{pmatrix}=
-\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial q_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial q_l} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial q_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial q_l}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial q_l}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial q_l}{\partial p_n}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation} 
The quantities forming the first matrix on the right-hand side, along with $M_h^2$, are easily calculated analytically. The remaining derivatives $\partial q_k /\partial p$ must be determined using the RGEs. Once these have been obtained, it is straightforward to solve for the $\partial v_i /\partial p$. The sensitivity coefficients $\Delta_p$ are then simply linear combinations of the $\partial v_i/\partial p$ and $\partial q_k/\partial p$. Radiative corrections may be easily incorporated by including the Coleman-Weinberg potential contributions in the EWSB conditions.\\ \\
The most involved step in the process of getting $\Delta_p$ is evaluating the matrix containing the derivatives $\partial q_k/\partial p$. In general this must be done numerically, by evaluating the running using the 1- and 2-loop RGEs. This is an obstacle to doing large scans of the parameter space, as the process of numerically evaluating $n\times l$ derivatives is computationally expensive. In general, for example for models defined at the GUT scale, accurately calculating the fine tuning is better done by numerically differentiating $M_Z^2$ directly to reduce the number of derivatives that must be computed. For studying models defined at low energies, as we do here, we can take advantage of the fact that the amount of running involved is small. This makes it possible to use approximate analytic solutions to the RGEs that exhibit good accuracy over the range of scales considered. Given the 2-loop RG equation for a parameter $q$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rge}
\frac{\textrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{1}{16\pi^2}\beta_q^{(1)}+\frac{1}{(16\pi^2)^2}\beta_q^{(2)},\qquad t\equiv \log\frac{Q}{M_X},
\end{equation}
a Taylor series expansion of the solution may be used to obtain the parameter at the scale $Q$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:rgeapproxsoln}
q(Q)&=q(M_X)+\int_0^t q(t')\;\textrm{d}t'\approx q(M_X)+\frac{t}{16\pi^2}\left ( \beta_q^{(1)}+\frac{\beta_q^{(2)}}{16\pi^2}\right )+\frac{t^2}{32\pi^2}\frac{\textrm{d}\beta_q^{(1)}}{\textrm{d}t}+\mathcal{O}(t^2).
\end{align}
Expanded to this order we obtain the leading log (LL) and next-to-LL (NLL) contributions at 2-loop order. The $\mathcal{O}(t^2)$ terms not displayed above are formally of 3-loop order and are neglected. The derivative of the 1-loop $\beta$ function is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1loopbetaderivative}
\frac{\textrm{d}\beta_q^{(1)}}{\textrm{d}t}=\frac{1}{16\pi^2}\sum_{q_k}\beta_{q_k}^{(1)}\frac{\partial \beta_q^{(1)}}{\partial q_k},
\end{equation}
where the sum is over all running parameters appearing in $\beta_q^{(1)}$. The $\beta$ functions appearing on the right hand side of Eqs. (\ref{eq:rgeapproxsoln}) and (\ref{eq:1loopbetaderivative}) are evaluated at the input scale $M_X$, giving a simple analytic expression for the parameters at the scale of EWSB in terms of the model parameters at $M_X$. Explicit results for the relevant series expansions in the MSSM and $E_6$ models are presented in Appendix \ref{app:rges}.
\subsection{\label{subsec:numericalprocedure}Numerical Procedure}
Using the approach outlined above, we have scanned the low energy parameter space of the MSSM and E$_6$SSM and calculated the fine tuning in each of the models considered. To do so, we implemented the above expressions for computing the fine tuning in a modified version of the E$_6$SSM spectrum generator that was used in \cite{Athron:2013ipa}. This code implemented 2-loop RGEs for all parameters except the soft scalar masses. In order to properly include the fine tuning impact of the $SU(3)$ gaugino soft mass $M_3$, we have extended the original code to make use of the 2-loop RGEs generated by SARAH \cite{Staub:2009bi,Staub:2010jh,Staub:2012pb,Staub:2013tta} and FlexibleSUSY \cite{Athron:2014yba}. The CP-even Higgs masses are calculated including the leading 1-loop effective potential contributions given in \cite{Athron:2009bs} and the leading 2-loop contributions. To scan over the MSSM parameter space, the equivalent MSSM fine tuning expressions were implemented into a modifed version of SOFTSUSY 3.3.10 \cite{Allanach:2001kg,Allanach:2013kza}. For consistency with the results produced in the $E_6$ models, and for computational speed, for our main scans only the dominant 1- and 2-loop corrections to the CP-even Higgs masses were included. The parameter ranges that were scanned over are presented in Table \ref{tab:scanranges}. With the exception of the stop mixing $A_t$, which was logarithmically scanned, all parameters were linearly scanned. All other parameters were decoupled by setting the remaining soft masses to values of $5$ TeV, while the first and second generation Yukawa couplings and their associated soft trilinears were taken to vanish. The $U(1)$ gaugino soft mass $M_1$ was fixed to $M_1=300$ GeV, and we fix $M_3=2000$ GeV. The input scale $M_X$ was set to $M_X=20$ TeV for both the MSSM and the $E_6$ models. Finally, the fine tuning was evaluated at the scale $Q=M_{\textrm{SUSY}}=\sqrt{m_{\tilde{t}_1}m_{\tilde{t}_2}}$, where $m_{\tilde{t}_{1,2}}$ are the running $\overline{\textrm{DR}}$ stop masses evaluated at $Q=M_{\textrm{SUSY}}$.

\section{\label{app:masterformula}Fine Tuning Master Formula}
% Tree level master formula for the E6SSM
To write down the tree level master formula, it is convenient to define the quantities
\begin{eqnarray}
z_1 &=& \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial s}\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial \tan\beta}-\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial \tan\beta}\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial s}\nonumber\\
z_2 &=& \frac{\partial f_3}{\partial s}\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial \tan\beta}-\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial \tan\beta}\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial s}\nonumber\\
z_3 &=& \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial s}\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial \tan\beta}-\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial \tan\beta}\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial s}\nonumber,
\end{eqnarray}
with $f_1,f_2,f_3$ as given in Eq. (\ref{eq:E6EWSBConditions}). Explicitly, we find that
\begin{eqnarray*}
z_1&=&%\frac{M_Z\cos^2\beta}{2\bar{g}^3}\Big [ 4M_Z^2\Big ( \sqrt{2}\lambda A_\lambda \cos\beta-2s(\lambda^2+g_1'^2\tilde{Q}_2\tild%e{Q}_S )\sin\beta\Big )\nonumber\\
%&& \times \Big ( \sqrt{2}\lambda A_\lambda \cos 2\beta+g_1'^2(\tilde{Q}_1-\tilde{Q}_2)\tilde{Q}_Ss\sin 2\beta \Big )\Big ]
\end{eqnarray*}
For a running parameter $q$ appearing in the tree level EWSB conditions, the corresponding contribution to the sensitivity coefficient may be written 
\be
\tilde{\Delta}_q=z_1\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial q}+z_2\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial q}+z_3\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial q}.
\label{eq:tuningContribution}
\ee
Similarly, the quantity $C$ appearing in Eq. (\ref{eq:E6masterformula}) is given by
\be
C=\frac{1}{2}\left ( z_1\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial M_Z}+z_2\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial M_Z}+z_3\frac{\partial f_3}{\partial M_Z}\right ),

\section{\label{app:rges}RGE Contributions}
% List the derivatives needed in the Taylor series approximation
% to the RGE solutions.
Provided that one does not run over too large a range of scales, the solutions to the
RG equations for a model can be reasonably well approximated by a Taylor series, Eq. (\ref{eq:rgeapproxsoln}).
Computing the first few terms of the series requires only the 1- and 2-loop RGEs, which are well known for
the MSSM and may be obtained from general results \cite{Martin:1993zk} for other models. To calculate the fine
tuning it is necessary to expand out all of the parameters appearing in the EWSB conditions in terms
of the high scale parameters.\\ \\
In the MSSM, the relevant parameters are $\mu$, $B$, $m_{H_u}^2$, $m_{H_d}^2$, $m_{Q3}^2$, $m_{u3}^2$ and $A_t$ when
the 1-loop top and stop effective potential terms are included (as no dimensionless couplings are varied
in the fine tuning calculation, we neglect expanding the gauge and Yukawa couplings). For a parameter $p$, the series expansion
Eq. (\ref{eq:rgeapproxsoln}) reads
\begin{equation*}
q(Q)=q(M_X)+\frac{t}{16\pi^2}\left ( \beta_q^{(1)}+\frac{\beta_q^{(2)}}{16\pi^2}\right )+\frac{t^2}{(16\pi^2)^2}b_q^{(2)}(M_X),
\end{equation*}
where we have for convenience defined
\begin{equation*}
b_q^{(2)}(M_X)=\frac{1}{2!}\left . \sum_{q_k}\beta_{q_k}^{(1)}\frac{\partial \beta_q}{\partial q_k}\right |_{M_X}
\end{equation*}
It is straightforward to get the explicit series expansions for the MSSM parameters listed above. Due to the smallness of the first and second
generation Yukawa couplings, we neglect them in our calculations. Similarly we neglect the corresponding soft SUSY breaking 
trilinears. Additionally, all soft mass matrices are assumed diagonal, and the gaugino masses are taken to be real.
For the MSSM, we then obtain the following results. For the parameter $\mu$, one has the coefficients
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:MSSMmubetas}
\begin{align}
\beta_\mu^{(1)}&=\mu\left ( 3y_t^2+3y_b^2+y_\tau^2-3g_2^2-\frac{3}{5}g_1^2\right ),\label{eq:MSSMmubeta1}\\
\beta_\mu^{(2)}&=\mu \bigg ( -9y_t^4-9y_b^4-6y_t^2y_b^2-3y_\tau^4+16g_3^2y_t^2+\frac{4}{5}g_1^2y_t^2+16g_3^2y_b^2-\frac{2}{5}g_1^2y_b^2\nonumber\\

It is then trivial to extract the relevant terms for the fine tuning calculation in the MSSM from these expressions.\\ \\
In $U(1)$ extended models the 2-loop RGEs are somewhat more lengthy even if $U(1)$ mixing effects are
neglected. As for the MSSM, we present simplified expressions in which it is assumed that the first and 
second generation Yukawas are zero along with the soft SUSY breaking trilinears. At tree level in the EWSB conditions
the parameters that must be expanded are $\lambda$, $A_\lambda$, $m_{H_u}^2$, $m_{H_d}^2$, $m_S^2$ and $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_1'$.
The coefficients in the expansion of $\lambda$ may be written
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:USSMLambdaBetas}
\begin{align}
\beta_{\lambda}^{(1)}&=\lambda\Big (2\lambda^2+2\Sigma_\lambda +3\Sigma_\kappa+ 3y_t^2 + 3y_b^2 + y_\tau^2-\frac{3}{5}g_1^2-3g_2^2-2g_1'^2\left (\tilde{Q}_1^2+\tilde{Q}_2^2+\tilde{Q}_S^2\right )\Big ), \label{eq:USSMLambdabeta1}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma_\lambda=\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2,\qquad \Sigma_\kappa=\kappa_1^2+\kappa_2^2+\kappa_3^2.
\end{equation*}
