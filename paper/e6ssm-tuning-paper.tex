With the discovery of a 125 GeV Standard Model (SM) like Higgs boson
and rising lower bounds on the masses of superpartners, minimal models
of low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) appear to be increasingly fine
tuned. In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) large stop
masses, needed to obtain the observed Higgs mass, give a significant
contribution to fine tuning. $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM that solve
the $\mu$-problem have new F- and D-term contributions to the Higgs
mass, allowing a 125 GeV Higgs with lighter stops and so alleviating
the associated fine tuning. However, it was recently demonstrated,
within a constrained version of the Exceptional Supersymmetric
Standard Model (E$_6$SSM) defined at the Grand Unification (GUT)
scale, that the presence of a massive $Z'$ boson introduces a
substantial new source of tuning in these theories at tree level. Here
we consider the impact of this tuning when we remove the fine tuning
that depends on assumptions about the SUSY breaking scale, by setting
the SUSY breaking parameters at low energies. We find that the
existing experimental bounds on the $Z'$ mass impose an effective
lower bound on the fine tuning, which does not depend on assumptions
about SUSY breaking.  We compare our results against the tuning in the
MSSM with the SUSY breaking terms also defined at low energies.

\section{\label{sec:intro}Introduction}
The discovery of an approximately 125 GeV Higgs
\cite{Aad:2012tfa,Chatrchyan:2012ufa} at the large hadron collider
(LHC) has interesting implications for physics beyond the standard
model (SM) and supersymmetry (SUSY).  On the one hand it provides a
light Higgs boson in fitting with expectations from supersymmetry, and
can be fitted in the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM).  On
the other hand it is slightly heavier than the constrained version of the 
MSSM (cMSSM) can accommodate naturally \cite{Cassel:2011zd,Ghilencea:2012gz}.

The Higgs causes a naturalness problem because at tree level it has an
upper bound of the mass of the $Z$ boson, $M_Z$. The dominant higher
order corrections to the Higgs mass come from stops and to obtain a
$125$ GeV Higgs they need be rather heavy. Heavy stops will provide a
large contribution to the soft breaking mass for the up-type Higgs
scalar, $m_{H_u}^2$ at low energies, through the evolution of the
renormalisation group equations (RGEs) from the grand unification
(GUT) scale to the electroweak (EW) scale. This affects the SUSY
prediction of the electroweak VEV, $v$, or $M_Z$.  This naturalness
problem motivates both further examination of non-minimal SUSY models
that can raise the Higgs mass without the need for heavy stops and
alternative possibilities for how the soft breaking parameters get
generated, which might set them them at lower energies, reducing the
influence the stops have on the soft breaking mass for the up-type
Higgs scalar, $m_{H_u}^2$.

In addition to that naturalness issue, often referred to as the little
hierarchy problem, the MSSM also suffers from the $\mu$-problem. This
is also a naturalness problem since there should be a natural explanation
of how the $\mu$ superpotential parameter can be set to the same scale
as the soft breaking masses.

U(1) extensions of the MSSM provide a very elegant solution to this
$\mu$-problem \cite{Fayet:1977yc, Kim:1983dt, Suematsu:1994qm,
  Cvetic:1995rj, Cvetic:1996mf, Jain:1995cb, Nir:1995bu,
  Cvetic:1997ky} and also raise the Higgs mass with new $F$- and
$D$-terms. Nonetheless, as was recently demonstrated in the context of
the exceptional supersymmetric standard model (E$_6$SSM)
\cite{King:2005jy,King:2005my,Athron:2010zz}, such models can still
suffer from naturalness problems with the mass of the new $Z^\prime$
associated with break down of the new U(1) appearing in the
electroweak symmetry breaking conditions at tree level
\cite{Athron:2013ipa}.  Nonetheless the constrained version of
E$_6$SSM (cE$_6$SSM) \cite{Athron:2009ue, Athron:2009bs} still turned
out to be significantly less tuned than the cMSSM.

However this comparison of fine tuning depends crucially upon the
assumptions of these gravity mediated SUSY breaking motivated
constrained models and in particular the way the universality
constraints are applied at the GUT scale.  As mentioned above, given
the findings at the LHC it is worth considering other possibilities,
which may allow the soft masses to be set at lower energies. As the
scale at which the parameters fulfill some breaking inspired
constraints is lowered the stop masses contribute less to the fine
tuning.

At the same time in U(1) extensions, lowering the UV boundary scale
for the RGE evolution also allows even larger $F$-term contributions
to the Higgs mass, so long as one only requires $\lambda$, the
coupling between the Singlet Higgs, $S$ and the up- and down-type
Higgs bosons, $H_u$ and $H_d$, to remain perturbative up to the UV
scale and not the all the way up to the GUT scale.

However the tuning from the $Z^\prime$ mass limit does not disappear
as the UV boundary condition is lowered. This tuning appears in the
EWSB conditions at tree level and is quite difficult to avoid without
introducing a pure gauge singlet \cite{Athron:2014pua}.



In this paper we investigate how big this tuning is if we bring this
scale all the way down to 20 TeV, effectively minimising contribution
from the stops. We find that the $Z^\prime$ limit is enough to already
require moderate fine tuning.  We also show this is comparable to the
situation in the MSSM defined at the same scale if chargino limit is
$700$ GeV, which is the most conservative limit on can obtain and
above the tuning from the stops, in both the MSSM and U(1) extensions.
We also show that the tuning from the stops becomes larger when the
high scale is raised to ?? whereas for the E$_6$SSM the minimum tuning
is lower than the MSSM above this scale.  Therefore it is clear that
which model is preferred and how large the tuning is depends on our
assumptions about SUSY breaking models.

However we also show that if the $Z^\prime$ limit is the extended to
?? then $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM will already suffer from a
severe tuning, irrespective of the UV boundary condition for the RGE
evolution.  Therefore the $Z^\prime$ constraint is amongst the most
important in terms of tuning and attacking natural supersymmetry
experimentally and the next run of the LHC will be crucial.



Here we will refer to U(1) extensions of the MSSM, which solve the
$\mu$-problem as the USSM \cite{Cvetic:1995rj, Jain:1995cb,
  Nir:1995bu, Cvetic:1996mf, Cvetic:1997ky}, while we will sometimes
specify that the models are inspired by $E_6$ by referring to them as
such. Finally we will also discuss specific models with complete $E_6$
matter multiplets at low energies and an extra $U(1)$ under which the
right handed neutrino remains interaction-less as
E$_6$SSM-variants\cite{Howl:2007zi, Braam:2009fi, Braam:2010sy,
  Hall:2011zq, Nevzorov:2012hs, Athron:2014pua}, with the E$_6$SSM
reserved for the original formulation of this model
\cite{King:2005jy,King:2005my,Athron:2010zz} original formulation of
the model.
 
$U(1)$ and $E_6$ inspired extensions of the MSSM have been studied
very widely in the literature \cite{Gunion:1989we, Gunion:1992hs,
  Binetruy:1985xm, Ellis:1986yg, Ibanez:1986si, Gunion:1986ky,
  Haber:1986gz, Baer:1987eb, Gunion:1987jd, Grifols:1986vr,
  Ellis:1986ip, Morris:1987fm, Drees:1987tp, Ma:1995xk,
  Suematsu:1997tv, Suematsu:1997qt, Suematsu:1997au, Keith:1996fv,
  Keith:1997zb, Gherghetta:1996yr, Demir:1998dk, Langacker:1998tc,
  Hambye:2000bn, Ma:2000jf} (or for reviews see
\cite{Hewett:1988xc,Langacker:2008yv}).  There has also been a lot of
work recently including investigations of the neutralino sector
\cite{Hesselbach:2001ri, Barger:2005hb, Choi:2006fz,
  Barger:2007nv};the relic abundance of dark matter
\cite{Kalinowski:2008iq}; GUT scale family symmetries which can
explain the hierarchy of masses in the fermion sector and their
associated mixings \cite{Stech:2008wd}; neurtrino physics
\cite{Kang:2004ix}; explanations of the matter-anti-matter asymmetry
of the universe though EW baryogensis or leptogensis
\cite{Hambye:2000bn,Ma:2000jf,Kang:2004pp}; dipole moments
\cite{GutierrezRodriguez:2006hb}; anomaly mediated SUSY breaking with
D-term contributions \cite{Asano:2008ju} and the (extended) Higgs
sectors \cite{Daikoku:2000ep,Ham:2008xf}.


In this paper we will often focus on a very well motivated $E_6$
inspired $U(1)$ extension, the Exceptional Supersymmetric Standard
Model (E$_6$SSM)\cite{King:2005jy,King:2005my,Athron:2010zz}.  In this
model since the right handed neutrino remains interaction-less they
may explain the tiny observed masses of neutrinos via the see-saw
mechanism and the baryon asymmetry in the universe via leptogenesis
\cite{Hambye:2000bn,King:2008qb, King:2008gw}.  Recently it has also
been studied in the context of electroweak baryogenesis
\cite{Chao:2014hya}.

The gauge coupling running in the E$_6$SSM at the two-loop level leads
to unification more precisely than in the MSSM \cite{King:2007uj} or
in slightly modified scenarios two-step unification can take place
\cite{Howl:2007hq,Howl:2007zi}. If the exotic particles are light in
these models this can open up non-standard decays of the SM--like
Higgs boson \cite{Hall:2010ix,Nevzorov:2013tta,Athron:2014pua}. The
correct relic abundance could be obtained entirely through an almost
decoupled ``inert'' neutralino sector \cite{Hall:2009aj},.  However
this is no longer phenomenologically viable due to limits from direct
detection of dark matter
\cite{2011PhRvL.107m1302A,2012PhRvL.109r1301A, Akerib:2013tjd} and due
to a significant suppression of the decay of the lightest Higgs boson
into SM states, due to a new channel into inert singlinos opening up.

There are still several remaining options. One may specialize to
scenarios known as the EZSSM \cite{Hall:2011zq} where the inert
singlinos, which cause these problems are entirely decoupled and the
relic abundance is fitted with a bino-like candidate with a novel
mechanism involving back-scattering into a Heavier inert
Higgsino. Another well motivated scenario admits two possible dark
matter candidates \cite{Nevzorov:2012hs}, where one will be an inert
singlino and the other will have a similar composition to MSSM
neutralinos. The simplest phenomenologically viable solution in that
case is to make the singlinos extremely light hot dark matter
candidate and explains almost all the relic abundance density with

The impact of gauge kinetic mixing in the case where both of the extra
U(1)'s appearing from the breakdown of E$_6$ are present at low energy
was studied in \cite{Rizzo:2012rf}.  The E$_6$SSM was also included in
a studies looking at how first or second generation sfermion masses
can be used to constrain the GUT scale parameters \cite{Miller:2012vn}
and the renormalization of VEVs \cite{Sperling:2013eva,
  Sperling:2013xqa}.  The particle spectrum and collider signatures of
constrained version of the E$_6$SSM have been studied in a series of
papers,
\cite{Athron:2009ue,Athron:2009bs,Athron:2011wu,Athron:2012sq}. The
threshold corrections to the $\overline{DR}$ gauge and Yukawa
couplings in the E$_6$SSM were calculated and the numerical impact in
the constrained version examined \cite{Athron:2012pw}.

As mentioned earlier the fine tuning of the cE$_6$SSM was recently studied
\cite{Athron:2013ipa} and there it was revealed that the associated
$Z^\prime$ boson leads to a new source of fine tuning since it's mass
appears in the EWSB conditions.  

In this paper we will examine this source of fine tuning in more
detail by considering low energy constructions where the usual fine
tuning problem from the Higgs is minimised.  We will also consider
alternate charges for the extra $U(1)$ symmetry to relax the focus on
the E$_6$SSM and demonstrate that this is quite a generic result.

To quantify the fine tuning we will employ the traditional
Barbieri-Giudice measure \cite{Ellis:1986yg,Barbieri:1987fn}.  This
has been used extensively within the literature
e.g. \cite{deCarlos:1993yy, deCarlos:1993ca, Chankowski:1997zh,
  Agashe:1997kn, Wright:1998mk, Kane:1998im, BasteroGil:1999gu,
  Feng:1999zg, Allanach:2000ii, Dermisek:2005ar, Barbieri:2005kf,
  Allanach:2006jc, Gripaios:2006nn, Dermisek:2006py, Barbieri:2006dq,
  Kobayashi:2006fh, Perelstein:2012qg, Antusch:2012gv,Cheng:2012pe,
  CahillRowley:2012rv, Ross:2012nr, Basak:2012bd, Kang:2012sy,
  Athron:2013ipa,Miller:2013jra, Binjonaid:2014oga, Miller:2014jza}.

A number of alternative measures have also been applied in the
literature \cite{Anderson:1994dz, Anderson:1994tr, Anderson:1995cp,
  Anderson:1996ew, Ciafaloni:1996zh, Chan:1997bi, Barbieri:1998uv,
  Giusti:1998gz, Casas:2003jx, Casas:2004uu, Casas:2004gh,
  Casas:2006bd, Kitano:2005wc, Athron:2007ry, Athron:2007qr,
  Baer:2012up} with varying motivations.  A very different approach is
to work within a Bayesian analysis.  There the concept of naturalness
is automatically incorporated since in models where one must fine tune
parameters to fit measured values of the observables, the region with
high likelihood will occupy a tiny prior volume \cite{Allanach:2007qk,
  Cabrera:2008tj, Ghilencea:2012gz, Ghilencea:2012qk, Fichet:2012sn,
  Kim:2013uxa} suppressing the posterior.  Indeed in the MSSM and
NMSSM if one transforms GUT scale parameters to the VEVs, the inverse
of the Jacobian for this transformation looks quite like the
derivatives that appear in the traditional fine tuning measure
\cite{Allanach:2007qk, Cabrera:2008tj, Kim:2013uxa}.  If one thinks
more generally then a model without fine tuning is one where the
parametrisation is such that all the parameters are observables
\cite{Fichet:2012sn, Kim:2013uxa}.  This provides a quite general
definition of fine tuning as $1/|J|$ where $|J|$ is the determinant of
the Jacobian for the co-ordinate transformation between the parameters
and the observables. Interestingly this means the tuning is the ratio
of the infinitesimal observable space space volume element to the
infinitesimal parameter space element and coincides with the measure
proposed in \cite{Athron:2007ry} when the interval of variation is
taken to zero.

While this approach has many merits here will employ the traditional
measure of fine tuning because it is both simple to apply and easy to
compare with previous results due to it's widespread use.  Fortunately
the derivatives which appear in these tuning are also similar to the
Bayesian motivated measure so there should not be too large a
discrepancy between the two approaches.


The structure of this paper is as follows.  In section \ref{sec:model}
we review the models we consider.  In section \ref{sec:ewsb} we
specify the EWSB conditions of the models, with particular focus on
how the $Z^\prime$ mass influences the prediction of $M_Z$.  Then in
section \ref{sec:tuning} we introduce our fine tuning measure and our
approach to evaluating it to obtain the individual sensitivities.  The
numerical procedure we use to obtain our results is given in
\ref{subsec:numericalprocedure} and then the results are specified in
section \ref{sec:results}.





 

\section{\label{sec:model}U(1) extensions and the E$_6$SSM}
In this paper we consider U(1) extensions of the MSSM where the gauge
group at low energies is, \be SU(3)_C\times SU(2)_W\times U(1)_Y\times
U(1)^\prime, \ee where $U(1)^\prime$ is the new gauge group beyond
that of the SM and MSSM. The minimal superfield content of $U(1)$
extensions which solve the $\mu$-problem should be ordinary left
handed quark, $\hat{Q}_i$ and lepton $\hat{L}_i$
($i=1,2,3$)superfields along with right handed superfields
$\hat{u}^c_i$, $\hat{d}^c_i$, $\hat{e}^c_i$ ($i=1,2,3$) for the
up-type (s)quarks, down-type (s)quarks and charged (s)leptons
respectively and three Higgs superfields, up-type $\hat{H}_u$,
down-type $\hat{H}_d$ and a singlet under the SM gauge group
$\hat{S}$.

  The couplings for the $U(1)^\prime$ gauge group should allow the
  following renormalisable superpotential terms required in the USSM,
  \be W_{USSM} = y^U_{ij} \hat{u}^c_i \hat{H}_u \hat{Q}_j + y^D_{ij}
  \hat{d}^c_i \hat{H}_d \hat{Q}_j + y^E_{ij} \hat{e}^c_i \hat{H}_d
  \hat{L}_j + \lambda \hat{S} \hat{H}_d \hat{H}_u, \ee with $i,j \in
  \{1,2,3\}$.


The $U(1)^\prime$ charges should allow for cancellations of gauge
anomalies. The most elegant way to do this is to use an extra $U(1)$
gauge symmetry that can be obtained from the break down of the $E_6$
gauge symmetry which is anomaly free and have all matter multiplets
from the $Z7$-plet representation of $E_6$ survive down to low energies.

The breaking of $E_6$ into $SO(10)$, gives rise to $E_6\to
SO(10)\times U(1)_{\psi}$, and the subsequent breaking of $SO(10)$
into $SU(5)$, gives $SO(10)\to SU(5)\times U(1)_{\chi}$ (this is
reviewed in e.g.~\cite{Langacker:2008yv}). The extra $U(1)$ gauge
symmetry at low energies should then be a linear combination of these
in the $E_6$ inspired case, \be U(1)^\prime = \cos(\theta) U(1)_{\chi}
+ \sin(\theta) U(1)_{\psi}.  \ee In table \ref{tab:E6charges} the
charges for several popular $E_6$ inspired $U(1)$ extensions are
shown.

\label{tab:E6charges}
\end{table}

To ensure anomaly cancellation in these cases the full matter content
from three generations of $27$-plets should survive to low energies.
the low energy matter content would then be extended to, \be
(\hat{Q}_i,\,\hat{u}^c_i,\,\hat{d}^c_i,\,\hat{L}_i,\,\hat{e}^c_i)
+(\hat{D}_i,\,\hat{\overline{D}}_i)+(\hat{S}_{i})+(\hat{H}^u_i)+(\hat{H}^d_i),\ee
where the $\hat{S}_{i}$, $\hat{H}^u_i$ and $\hat{H}^d_i$ are three
generations of doublets, whose quantum numbers will be like the
singlet, and up-, down-type Higgs fields and the $\hat{D}_i$ and
$\hat{\overline{D}}_i$ being $SU(3)_C$ triplets that reside in the
same $SU(5)$ multiplets as these Higgs-like states.

If one wishes to maintain gauge coupling unification this set of
states should be augmented by two extra $SU(2)$ doublet states
$H^\prime$ and $\overline{H}^\prime$ belonging to other $27^\prime$
and $\overline{27}^\prime$ multiplets that must be incomplete at low
energies.

The full superpotential for $E_6$ inspired models will then be,

\be
W_{E6} = W_0 + W_1 + W_2,
\label{Eq:e6-superpot}
\ee where
\begin{eqnarray}
W_0 &=& \lambda_{ijk} \hat{S}_i \hat{H}^d_{j} \hat{H}^u_{k} + \kappa_{ijk} \hat{S}_i \hat{D}_j \hat{\bar{D}}_k + h^N_{ijk} \hat{N}^c_i \hat{H}^u_{j} \hat{L}_k \nonumber \\
& & + h^U_{ijk} \hat{u}^c_i \hat{H}^u_{j} \hat{Q}_k + h^D_{ijk} \hat{d}^c_i \hat{H}^d_{j} \hat{Q}_k + h^E_{ijk} \hat{e}^c_i \hat{H}^d_{j} \hat{L}_k, \\
W_1 &=& g^Q_{ijk} \hat{D}_i \hat{Q}_j \hat{Q}_k + g^q_{ijk} \hat{\bar{D}}_i \hat{d}^c_j \hat{u}^c_k, \\
W_2 &=& g^N_{ijk} \hat{N}^c_i \hat{D}_j \hat{d}^c_k + g^E_{ijk} \hat{e}^c_i \hat{D}_j \hat{u}^c_k + g^D_{ijk} \hat{Q}_i \hat{L}_j \hat{\bar{D}}_k.
\label{Eq:e6-superpot-parts}
\end{eqnarray}

Nonetheless while this model is very elegant so far, the
superpotential, (\ref{Eq:e6-superpot}) contains dangerous terms which
can induce proton decay and lead to large flavour changing neutral
currents (FCNCs).  There are a number of approaches to suppress these
terms, involving the use of different discrete symmetries.  Here for
the purposes of renormalisation group running we will simply include
the following unsuppressed superpotential terms, which follows the
approach taking in work on the cE$_6$SSM \cite{Athron:2009ue,

In these expressions $g_2$, $g'=\sqrt{3/5}g_1$, and $g_1'$ are the
$SU(2)$, (non-GUT normalized) $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)'$ gauge couplings,
respectively, and $\bar{g}^2=g_2^2+g'^2$. The charges $\tilde{Q}_1$,
$\tilde{Q}_2$ and $\tilde{Q}_S$ are effective $U(1)'$ charges for
$H_1$, $H_2$ and $S$, respectively. Note that the $SU(2)$ dot product
is defined by $A\cdot B\equiv \epsilon_{\alpha\beta}A^\alpha
B^\beta=A^2B^1-A^1B^2$. The term $\Delta V_{E_6}$ contains the
Coleman-Weinberg contributions to the effective potential. In the case
of the $U(1)_\chi$ model, $V_{E_6}^F$ may also contain an elementary
$\mu$ term contribution, as occurs in the MSSM.\\ \\ Demanding that
the Higgs fields $H_1$, $H_2$ and the singlet $S$ acquire real VEVs of
the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6vevs}
\langle H_1 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} v_1 \\ 0\end{pmatrix}, \; \langle H_2 \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix}, \; \langle S \rangle =\frac{s}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
at the physical minimum leads to the minimization conditions
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:E6EWSBConditions}
\begin{align}
&f_1=m_{H_d}^2v_1+\frac{\lambda^2}{2}(v_2^2+s^2)v_1-\frac{\lambda A_\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}sv_2-\frac{\bar{g}^2}{8}
(v_2^2-v_1^2)v_1+D_{H_1}v_1+\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_1}=0,\label{eq:E6EWSBcondition1} \\
&f_2=m_{H_u}^2v_2+\frac{\lambda^2}{2}(v_1^2+s^2)v_2-\frac{\lambda A_\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}sv_1+\frac{\bar{g}^2}{8}
(v_2^2-v_1^2)v_2+D_{H_2}v_2+\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_2}=0,\label{eq:E6EWSBcondition2} \\
&f_3=m_S^2s+\frac{\lambda^2}{2}(v_2^2+v_1^2)s-\frac{\lambda A_\lambda}{\sqrt{2}}v_2v_1+D_Ss+\frac{\partial \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial s}=0.\label{eq:E6EWSBcondition3}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The quantities $D_{H_1}$, $D_{H_2}$ and $D_S$ appearing above are
$U(1)'$ $D$-term contributions that are absent in the MSSM and NMSSM
and are given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6Dterms}
D_\phi\equiv \frac{g_1'^2}{2}\left (
\tilde{Q}_1v_1^2+\tilde{Q}_2v_2^2+\tilde{Q}_Ss^2\right
)\tilde{Q}_\phi.
\end{equation}
As was noted in \cite{Athron:2013ipa}, the first two of these
conditions may be rewritten in the form
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6MZequation}
\frac{M_Z^2}{2}=-\frac{\lambda^2s^2}{2}+\frac{\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2-\tilde{m}_{H_u}^2\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1}+\frac{D_{H_1}-D_{H_2}\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:E6sin2bequation}
\sin 2\beta=\frac{\sqrt{2}\lambda A_{\lambda} s}{\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2+\tilde{m}_{H_u}^2+\lambda^2s^2+D_{H_1}+D_{H_2}},
\end{equation}
with $M_Z^2=\bar{g}^2v^2/4$, $v^2=v_1^2+v_2^2$ and $\tan\beta =
v_2/v_1$ and where we have for convenience absorbed the effects of the
loop corrections into the soft masses,
\begin{align*}
\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2&=m_{H_d}^2+\frac{1}{v_1}\frac{\partial \Delta
  V_{E_6}}{\partial
  v_1},\\ \tilde{m}_{H_u}^2&=m_{H_u}^2+\frac{1}{v_2}\frac{\partial
  \Delta V_{E_6}}{\partial v_2}.
\end{align*}
Written in the form of Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}) we see the
potential new source of fine tuning alluded to above, in the form of
the third term on the right-hand side. For large values of the VEV
$s$, the $D$-term contributions can be quite a bit larger than
$M_Z^2$. In particular, recent experimental limits \cite{Aad:2014cka}
require that the $Z'$ mass be large, with bounds of $M_{Z'}\gtrsim
2.51$ TeV in $U(1)_\psi$ models and $M_{Z'}\gtrsim 2.62$ TeV in
$U(1)_\chi$ models. To satisfy these limits typically requires large
values of the singlet VEV $s$. For example $s\gtrsim 6$ TeV is
required in the E$_6$SSM with $U(1)'=U(1)_N$, so that
$|D_{H_1}|,|D_{H_2}|\gg M_Z^2$ for $E_6$ models with $\tilde{Q}_S\neq
0$. As a result the remaining terms on the right-hand side of
Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}) must be tuned to cancel the resulting very
large contribution to $M_Z$. Moreover, because this is a large tree
level fine tuning, it may negate the increase in naturalness that is
associated with having a reduced need for heavy superpartners. In
$U(1)$ extended models for which $\tilde{Q}_S\neq 0$, the importance
of the $Z^\prime$ mass to the fine tuning in these models can be made
even clearer by writing Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}) in the form given
in \cite{Athron:2013ipa},
\begin{equation}\label{eq:originalE6MZequation}
c(\theta,\tan\beta)\frac{M_Z^2}{2}=-\frac{\lambda^2 s^2}{2}+\frac{\tilde{m}_{H_d}^2-\tilde{m}_{H_u}^2\tan^2\beta}{\tan^2\beta-1}+d(\theta,\tan\beta)\frac{M_{Z^\prime}^2}{2}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{align}
c(\theta,\tan\beta)&=1-\frac{4}{\left ( \tan^2\beta-1\right )}\frac{g_1'^2}{\bar{g}^2}\left ( \tilde{Q}_1-\tilde{Q}_2\tan^2\beta \right )\left ( \tilde{Q}_1\cos^2\beta+\tilde{Q}_2\sin^2\beta \right ),\label{eq:cdefn}\\
d(\theta,\tan\beta)&= \frac{\tilde{Q}_1-\tilde{Q}_2\tan^2\beta}{\tilde{Q}_S\left ( \tan^2\beta - 1\right )}.\label{eq:ddefn}
\end{align}
Written like so it is evident that the fine tuning contribution coming
from the new $D$-terms depends both on the $U(1)'$ charges and the
$Z^\prime$ mass, and that the tuning can be expected to increase with
$M_{Z^\prime}$. As shall be shown below, the exact size of this tuning
then depends strongly on the choice of $U(1)'$ charges, via the
coefficient $d$.

\subsection{\label{subsec:tuningmeasure}The Fine Tuning Measure}
As stated above, in order to quantify the resulting fine tuning we
apply the traditional Ellis-Barbieri-Giudice measure
\cite{Ellis:1986yg,Barbieri:1987fn}. A specific model is characterised
by a set of $n$ model parameters $\{p_i\}$ and is defined at some
input scale $M_X$. For a given parameter $p$ in this set, one computes
an associated sensitivity coefficient \cite{Feng:2013pwa}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bgmeasure}
\Delta_p=\left | \frac{\partial \log M_Z^2}{\partial \log p}\right
|=\left | \frac{p}{M_Z^2}\frac{\partial M_Z^2}{\partial p}\right |,
\end{equation}
where $M_Z^2=\bar{g}^2v^2/4$. The coefficient $\Delta_p$ measures the
fractional variation in $M_Z^2$ resulting from a given variation in
the parameter $p$. The overall fine tuning is then taken to be $\Delta
= \underset{i}{\max}\,\{\Delta_{p_i}\}$.\\ \\

The sensitivity coefficients $\Delta_p$ may be calculated directly
from the expression for $M_Z^2$ in terms of the $p_i$ for a particular
model, which leads to a so-called master formula for calculating the
fine tuning. A master formula for the E$_6$SSM, obtained from the tree
level scalar potential, was presented in \cite{Athron:2013ipa}. In
order to derive the expression presented there, the fact that $s \gg
v$ was made use of to neglect certain $O(v^2)$ terms in the EWSB
conditions, greatly simplifying the final result. For the purposes of
exploring a wider class of $E_6$ inspired models, we have rederived
the master formula without neglecting any $O(v^2)$ terms. The more
complete tree-level master formula is somewhat complicated. This is
because, unlike in the MSSM, even at tree level it is not possible to
solve explicitly for the VEVs $v_1$, $v_2$ in terms of the Lagrangian
parameters. It may be written in the form \be \Delta_p=|C|^{-1}\times
\frac{|p|}{M_Z}\bigg|\sum_{q}\tilde{\Delta}_q\frac{\partial
  q}{\partial p}\bigg|,
\label{eq:E6masterformula}
\ee where the sum is over all low energy running parameters appearing
in the tree level EWSB conditions, i.e. $q\in\{\lambda, A_\lambda,
m_{H_d}^2,m_{H_u}^2,m_S^2,g_1,g_2,g_1'\}$. Expressions for the
quantity $C$ and the $\tilde{\Delta}_q$ appearing above are given in
Appendix \ref{app:masterformula}. It should be noted that the effects
of $U(1)$ mixing are neglected in deriving
Eq. (\ref{eq:E6masterformula}).\\ \\ However, it is well known in the
MSSM that radiative corrections can significantly change (indeed,
reduce) the fine tuning \cite{Cassel:2010px}. It is therefore
important when studying the fine tuning to include loop corrections to
the effective potential in the fine tuning measure. To do so it is
most convenient to work in terms of the EWSB conditions
Eq. (\ref{eq:E6EWSBConditions}), rather than
Eq. (\ref{eq:E6MZequation}). The general procedure is as follows
\cite{Ellwanger:2011mu}. For a model in which $m$ fields develop real
VEVs (e.g. $m=2$ in the MSSM, $m=3$ in the NMSSM and in the $E_6$
models considered), we require that the $m$ minimization conditions
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EWSBconditions}
f_1=f_2=\dotsb=f_m=0
\end{equation}
continue to hold under an arbitrary variation in a model parameter
$p\rightarrow p+\delta p$, so that the variations $\delta f_i$ satisfy
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EWSBvariations}
\delta f_1 = \delta f_2=\dotsb =\delta f_m =0.
\end{equation}
Each $f_i$ is a function of the VEVs $v_j$ and $l$ running parameters
$q_k$ evaluated at the scale of EWSB, $f_i=f_i(v_j,q_k)$. Thus for
each $f_i$ we have that
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EWSBchainrule}
\delta f_i = \sum_{j=1}^m \frac{\partial f_i}{\partial
  v_j}\frac{\partial v_j}{\partial p}+\sum_{k=1}^l \frac{\partial
  f_i}{\partial q_k}\frac{\partial q_k}{\partial p}=0.
\end{equation}
The quantities $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial v_j}$ are the elements of
the CP-even Higgs squared mass matrix $M_h^2$ of the model before
rotating into the mass eigenstate basis. When evaluated for all $n$
model parameters, the above system of equations can be concisely
expressed as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tuningsystem}
M_h^2\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial v_1}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial v_m}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial v_m}{\partial p_n}
\end{pmatrix}=
-\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial q_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial q_l} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial f_m}{\partial q_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial q_l}
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial q_1}{\partial p_n} \\
\vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\frac{\partial q_l}{\partial p_1} & \cdots & \frac{\partial q_l}{\partial p_n}
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation} 
The quantities forming the first matrix on the right-hand side, along
with $M_h^2$, are easily calculated analytically. The remaining
derivatives $\partial q_k /\partial p$ must be determined using the
RGEs. Once these have been obtained, it is straightforward to solve
for the $\partial v_i /\partial p$. The sensitivity coefficients
$\Delta_p$ are then simply linear combinations of the $\partial
v_i/\partial p$ and $\partial q_k/\partial p$. Radiative corrections
may be easily incorporated by including the Coleman-Weinberg potential
contributions in the EWSB conditions.\\ \\ Evaluating the derivatives
$\partial q_k/\partial p$ must (in general) be done by numerically
integrating the two-loop RGEs. This is time consuming and presents an
obstacle to doing large scans of the parameter space. For studying
models defined at low energies, as we do here, we can take advantage
of the fact that the amount of running involved is small. This makes
it possible to use approximate analytic solutions to the RGEs that
exhibit good accuracy over the range of scales considered. Given the
two-loop RG equation for a parameter $q$,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:rge}
\frac{\textrm{d}q}{\mathrm{d}t}=\frac{1}{16\pi^2}\beta_q^{(1)}+\frac{1}{(16\pi^2)^2}\beta_q^{(2)},\qquad t\equiv \log\frac{Q}{M_X},
\end{equation}
a Taylor series expansion of the solution may be used to obtain the
parameter at the scale $Q$,
\begin{align}\label{eq:rgeapproxsoln}
q(Q)&=q(M_X)+\int_0^t q(t')\;\textrm{d}t'\approx q(M_X)+\frac{t}{16\pi^2}\left ( \beta_q^{(1)}+\frac{\beta_q^{(2)}}{16\pi^2}\right )+\frac{t^2}{32\pi^2}\frac{\textrm{d}\beta_q^{(1)}}{\textrm{d}t}+\mathcal{O}(t^2).
\end{align}
Expanded to this order we obtain the leading log (LL) and next-to-LL
(NLL) contributions at two-loop order. The $\mathcal{O}(t^2)$ terms
not displayed above are formally of 3-loop order and are
neglected. The derivative of the one-loop $\beta$ function is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:1loopbetaderivative}
\frac{\textrm{d}\beta_q^{(1)}}{\textrm{d}t}=\frac{1}{16\pi^2}\sum_{q_k}\beta_{q_k}^{(1)}\frac{\partial \beta_q^{(1)}}{\partial q_k},
\end{equation}
where the sum is over all running parameters appearing in
$\beta_q^{(1)}$. The $\beta$ functions appearing on the right hand
side of Eqs. (\ref{eq:rgeapproxsoln}) and
(\ref{eq:1loopbetaderivative}) are evaluated at the input scale $M_X$,
giving a simple analytic expression for the parameters at the scale of
EWSB in terms of the model parameters at $M_X$. Explicit results for
the relevant series expansions in the MSSM and $E_6$ models are
presented in Appendix \ref{app:rges}.
\subsection{\label{subsec:numericalprocedure}Numerical Procedure}
Using the approach outlined above, we are able to scan the low energy
parameter space of the MSSM and E$_6$SSM and calculate the fine tuning
in each. To do so, we implemented the above expressions for computing
the fine tuning in a modified version of the E$_6$SSM spectrum
generator that was used in \cite{Athron:2013ipa}. This code
implemented two-loop RGEs for all parameters except the soft scalar
masses. In order to properly include the fine tuning impact of the
$SU(3)$ gaugino soft mass $M_3$, we have extended the original code to
make use of the two-loop RGEs generated by SARAH
\cite{Staub:2009bi,Staub:2010jh,Staub:2012pb,Staub:2013tta} and
FlexibleSUSY \cite{Athron:2014yba}. The CP-even Higgs masses are
calculated including the leading one-loop effective potential
contributions given in \cite{Athron:2009bs} and the leading two-loop
contributions. To scan over the MSSM parameter space, the equivalent
MSSM fine tuning expressions were implemented into a modifed version
of SOFTSUSY 3.3.10 \cite{Allanach:2001kg,Allanach:2013kza}. For
consistency with the results produced in the $E_6$ models, and for
computational speed, for our main scans only the dominant one- and
two-loop corrections to the CP-even Higgs masses were
included. Finally, in all of the results below the fine tuning was
evaluated at the scale
$Q=M_{\textrm{SUSY}}=\sqrt{m_{\tilde{t}_1}m_{\tilde{t}_2}}$, where
$m_{\tilde{t}_{1,2}}$ are the running $\overline{\textrm{DR}}$ stop
masses evaluated at $Q=M_{\textrm{SUSY}}$.

\section{\label{sec:results}Results}
% Our results. Plots to go in here:
%    - tuning as a function of stop mass for the MSSM and E6SSM
As discussed in the introduction many recent papers interested in
natural supersymmetry have focussed on light stops, with much
theoretical effort to find models where it is easier to get a $125$
GeV Higgs boson and light stops simultaneously and much experimental
efforts to search for light stops.  This is entirely appropriate since
there are many good reasons to expect the soft masses to be set at
high energies.  However that is not the only possibility and the fine
tuning problem depends strongly on the RG evolution from the GUT
scale, as the soft Higgs masses that appear in the EWSB conditions
pick up contributions from the soft squark masses.

\label{Fig:mssmstoptuning}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
To illustrate this, in the left panel of Fig.~\ref{Fig:mssmstoptuning}
we show the variation in fine tuning when we scan over the stop masses
and mixing, with $500 \textrm{ GeV} \leq m_{Q_3},m_{u_3}\leq
10\textrm{ TeV}$ and $-3810\textrm{ GeV}\leq A_t\leq -20\textrm{
  GeV}$, for $M_X=20$ TeV, $50$ TeV and $100$ TeV.  The remaining
parameters we fix such that at $M_{SUSY}$ they have the values
$\mu=-97.5$ GeV, $B=-84.8$ GeV, $M_1=92.1$ GeV, $M_2=95.9$ GeV,
$M_3=352$ GeV, $A_b=-117.9$ GeV, $A_\tau=-7.8$ GeV, $m_{L_i}=400$ GeV,
$m_{e_i}=204$ GeV, $m_{Q_{1,2}}=438$ GeV, $m_{u_{1,2}}436$ GeV and
$m_{d_i}=438$ GeV ($i=1,2,3$). Although we should stress that making
this choice will lead to a spectrum which is in conflict with the LHC
limits, doing so ensures that fine tuning due to the other parameters
is small, so that we avoid washing out the fine tuning impact of the
stops when the tuning is small\footnote{For models in which the
  spectrum is heavier, when the stop masses are small the fine tuning
  reaches a lower bound imposed by other heavier parameters.} as can
be the case when the stop masses are less than 1 TeV.  Note that the
Higgs mass is also allowed to vary in this scan, as shown in the right
panel of Fig.~\ref{Fig:mssmstoptuning}. This illustrates the tuning
problem which people have been worrying about since the discovery of
the 125 GeV Higgs boson as we see that raising the stop masses is also
pushing up the Higgs mass, meaning that heavier Higgs masses require
more fine tuning.  However for a low value of the UV scale this tuning
is not so severe unless the stops are very heavy, and a 125 geV Higgs
can be obtained without much tuning in this unrealistic case where we
have minimised other sources of tuning.  On the other hand the tuning
becomes more severe as we increase the cutoff such that for $M_X =
10^{16}$ GeV a lightest stop masses of $1-3$ TeV can result in a fine
tuning of $\approx 100 - 1000$ and the minimum tuning we see consistent
with a $125$ GeV Higgs is $\approx 200$, as shown in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:mssmstoptuning}.

%      M_Z' values

Since the stop mass does not have such a large impact on the fine
tuning when the cutoff scale is very low we can use this to see more
clearly the impact of the $Z^\prime$ mass on fine tuning. To do so we
select a fixed low cutoff of $M_X=20$ TeV and compare the fine tuning
for two different values of the $Z^\prime$ mass. We choose to look at
$M_{Z^\prime}=2.5$ TeV, which is just above the current limits, and
$M_{Z^\prime}=4.5$ TeV, which should be in reach in run II at the LHC
and then compare the fine tuning calculated in each case to the tuning
in the MSSM.  For this, we have performed a large six dimensional
parameter space scan in both the MSSM and E$_6$SSM, varying those
parameters most relevant for the fine tuning and the Higgs mass.
Therefore the set of parameters which we vary includes $\mu$, $B$ and
$\tan \beta$ for the MSSM, and $\lambda$, $A_\lambda$ and $\tan
\beta$, for the E$_6$SSM, which appear at tree level in the EWSB
conditions of the models. While the contribution from large stop
masses to the fine tuning is small for such a low cut-off scale, the
stop contributions to the effective potential can play a significant
role in reducing the fine tuning.  For this reason it is still
important to properly treat the tuning associated with stop
contributions to the one-loop effective potential, and so we also scan
over the soft masses $m_{Q_3}^2$, $m_{u_3}^2$ and the stop mixing
$A_t$.  The relevant parameters and ranges that were scanned over are
summarised in Table \ref{tab:scanranges}. With the exception of the
stop mixing $A_t$ and the soft trilinear $A_\lambda$, which are
logarithmically scanned, all parameters are linearly scanned.  In
addition to this we also repeat each scan for three different values
of $M_2$ to allow more variation in the chargino masses.

 In this case we now consider realistic scenarios, where the
 parameters that are not scanned over are set to values which keep the
 associated states comfortably above their experimental limits.  So in
 both the MSSM and E$_6$SSM, all other soft scalar masses are set
 to $5$ TeV.  Since we work in the third family approximation, taking
 the first and second generation Yukawa couplings to be zero, we also
 assume their associated soft trilinears vanish. Similarly we take
$A_b=A_\tau=0$ GeV. The $U(1)$ gaugino soft mass $M_1$ was fixed to
 $M_1=300$ GeV, and we fix $M_3=2000$ GeV. Additionally, in the
 E$_6$SSM the $U(1)_N$ gaugino soft mass $M_1'$ is held fixed with
 $M_1'=M_1=300$ GeV, and $\mu^\prime=5$ TeV.

In Fig \ref{Fig:e6ssmvsmssm} results from the scan are plotted showing
the tuning for each case against the lightest Higgs mass.  As expected
the dependence on the Higgs mass is now quite weak, while the minimum
tuning in the model for the E$_6$SSM is increased by the mass of the
$Z^\prime$ boson.  So in the case of a very low cutoff the tuning
required to get a 125 GeV Higgs is not so large.  However the tuning
from the $Z^\prime$ mass appears already at tree level and is
therefore not heavily suprressed when the cutoff scale is low. We find
that in the E$_6$SSM current limits on the mass of the $Z^\prime$
boson imply that the E$_6$SSM fine tuning is at least 100.
Additionally if run II of the LHC pushes the limit on the $Z^\prime$
mass to be above $4.5$ TeV then the fine tuning in the model will be
greater than at least 350.

This demopnstrates two important points about these $U(1)$
extensions. Firstly that limits on the $Z^\prime$ mass play an
incredibly important role in constraining natural scenarios in such
models and secondly that the tuning from the $Z^\prime$ limits in
these models depends on less assumptions about SUSY breaking than the
tuning required by the $125$ GeV Higgs measurement which concerns
people in the MSSM.

However we should also acknowledge that there are other limits which
play a similar role.  Chargino limits directly constrain the $\mu$
parameter (or effective $\mu$ parameter in these $U(1)$ extensions).
However the chargino limits from the LHC are scenario dependent and
depending on whether there are light sleptons or sneutralinos and the mass
difference between the lightest chargino and lightest neutralino.
Current limits placed by CMS and ATLAS extend up to $m_{\chi^\pm_1}
\approx 700-740$ GeV if there are light
sleptons\cite{Khachatryan:2014qwa,Aad:2014nua} with much weaker bounds
if there are no light sleptons or sneutrinos\footnote{Useful summary
  plots of these limit may be found on the public pages of ATLAS,
  \url{https://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/GROUPS/PHYSICS/CombinedSummaryPlots/SUSY/ATLAS_SUSY_EWSummary/ATLAS_SUSY_EWSummary.png}
  and CMS
  \url{http://cms.web.cern.ch/sites/cms.web.cern.ch/files/styles/large/public/field/image/Image_03_exclusion_Combined.png?itok=8FMBpu_1}.}.




Nonetheless the MSSM the impact of chargino limit is shown in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:chargino-plot}.  There we see that if the the full
  parameter space with $m_{\chi^\pm} < 700$ GeV was excluded the
  impact would be to make the tuning in the MSSM with a $20$ TeV
  cutoff slightly worse than that of the E$_6$SSM with the same cutoff
  and a $Z^\prime$ mass just larger than current limits.  would be
  similar to that can also be attcked more directly by looking at
  chargino mass limits as this rasies $\mu$ directly.  In the
  E$_6$SSM, while raising the chargino limit can have the same impact
  in principle, due to current limits on the $Z^\prime$ mass already
  imposing a significant degree of tuning, chargino masses do not make
  much of a noticable change.

The exact level of tuning from the $Z^\prime$ depends on the charges
of the extra $U(1)$ gauge symmetry it is associated with.  In
Fig.~\ref{Fig:othere6modelsvsmssm} we look at the fine tuning for
other U(1) extensions for the same $Z^\prime$ masses as we did for the
E$_6$SSM.  To simplify the analysis we fix $\tan \beta = 10$, but scan
over the remaining parameters as in Table \ref{tab:scanranges} and fix
the rest to the same values we did in the scan carried out for
Fig.~\ref{Fig:e6ssmvsmssm}.

\end{center}
\end{figure}

As can be seen in Fig.~\ref{Fig:othere6modelsvsmssm} the severity of the tunings varies quite
a bit.  This is because the charges appear as coefficients in front of
the $Z^\prime$ mass in the EWSB condition.  These charges change the
value of the coefficient $d$ in Eq. (\ref{eq:originalE6MZequation}).
The values of the coefficient $d$ in each model, for $\tan\beta = 10$,
is $\{-0.01, 0.40, 0.50, 0.81 \}$ for $\{U(1)_I, U(1)_N, U(1)_\psi,
U(1)_\eta \}$ and this determines which of the models are most tuned.

Interestingly the coefficient $d$ is very small (and negative) in the
case of the $U(1)_I$.  This allows a dramatic reduction in the fine
tuning from the $U(1)_I$ symmetry.  This is a result of the $H_u$
charge associated with $U(1)_I$ vansihing, which means that the
D-terms to the lightest Higgs which is predominantly $H_u$ at large
$\tan \beta$ are suppressed, making it difficult to raise the Higgs
mass in the same way as happens in the other models and explaining why
% DH:: I strongly suspect that they are invalid - but running scan
% to check this currently
the heavier Higgs values are less well populated [can't be obtained? -
are we sure those scattered points are valid?]  than in the other
models.  Therefore the fine tuining behaviour in this model is closer
to that of the MSSM, though the LHC can still constrain the most
natural scenarions from just placing tougher limits on the $Z^\prime$
mass .

[We should add some discussion about the $U(1)_I$ and the physics of
  that model here, since it has the lowest tuning.]

Finally we want to emphasise that while in Fig.~\ref{Fig:e6ssmvsmssm}
the E$_6$SSM looks more fine tuned than the MSSM this depends on the
cutoff scale.  Indeed in \cite{Athron:2013ipa} a constrained version
of the E$_6$SSM, with the cutoff at the GUT scale, is considered and
there the cE$_6$SSM was found to be less tuned than the cMSSM. Since a
125 GeV Higgs can be achieved in the E$_6$SSM with ligher stops, then
if the cutoff is large, the larger stop masses of the MSSM can make
that model more fine tuned due to large RGE effects.


To further illustrate point we looked at how the tuning compares for a
low tuning benchmarks in the MSSM and E6SSM when the highscale
boundary condition, $M_X$ is raised.  The results of this are shown in
Fig.~\ref{Fig:BMs-varyMX} where in the top panel we see that in this
case the dependence of the E6SSM tuning on the cutoff is rather
complicated leading, such that any statement about which model is more
tuned depends on the cutoff scale considered.  

The complicated shape of the E6SSM fine tuning curve can be understood
by looking at the indivual sensitivities shown in bottom left panel.
In this case one can see that the tuning is initially dominated by the
$\Delta_\lambda$ sensitivity, which contains some terms proprtional to
$M_Z^{\prime \, 2}$.  As the cutoff scale is raised however fine
tuning contributions from the stops and gluino start to feed into the
sensitivities, in particular $\Delta_{m_{H_u}^}2$ and $\Delta_\lamda$.
In the latter these contribution have the opposite sign to those from
$M_Z^\prime$ leading to this strange behaviour where $\Delta_\lambda$
passes through zero.  However in $\Delta_{m_{H_u}^}2$ dominating at
larger values of the cutoff scale we see the effect of the more common
fine tuning problem where the stops add large contributions to
$m_{H_u}^2$ , in this case leading to a large cancellation between
$m_{H_u}^2(M_X)$ and $m_{Q_3}^2(M_X)$ inside $m_{H_u}^2(M_{SUSY})$.

In the MSSM the panel on the bottom right shows that the largest
tuning contributions come from $\Delta_{A_t}$ and $\Delta_{m_{H_u}^2}$
with the former being the larger sensitivity until $M_X\approx 10^8$
at which point $\Delta_{m_{H_u}^2}$ takes over.  

In this particular case the fine tuning of the E$_6$SSM benchmark becomes larger than that od the MSSM benchmark when $M_X\approx 10^{10}-10^{11}$ GeV. This is diue to ? large A_t mixing?, $M_3$? different RGEs?

\section{\label{sec:conclusion}Conclusions}

Prior to stringent experimental constraints on the mass of the
lightest Higgs boson and squarks in supersymmetric models, a simple
picture of a natural SUSY model emerged from theoretical reasoning,
with soft masses set to similar values at the GUT scale through local
gravity interactions with the hidden sector.  Through the use of
renormalisation group running one can then see that at the EW scale
the stops and soft Higgs masses (which appear directly in the EWSB
conditions) should appear in the the EWSB condition for $M_Z$ and
therefore it was expected that these masses should not be much bigger
than $100$ GeV.  However to disturb this elegant picture first LEP
placed constraints on the Higgs mass, requiring it to be above 114.4
GeV \cite{}, which already introduced significant tuning for
constrained models,and then the LHC measured the Higgs to be around
$125$ GeV, since heavy stops are required to raised the lightest
Higgs mass above it's tree level bound.

$U(1)$ extensions motivated by the $\mu$-problem, $E_6$ GUT theories
and the connection to string theory contain both $F-$ and $D-$ term
contributions to the light Higgs mass which can raise the tree level
mass, evading the need for large radiative corrections to increase it.
However such models come with their own fine tuning problem, where the
$Z^\prime$ mass appears in the EWSB condition for $M_Z$ at tree level.
While in a previous study of the constrained E$_6$SSM it was found
that the tuning is less severe than the MSSM, it was still significant.


In light of such difficulties it is worth considering whether the
simple picture which emerged is wrong in some way and if there are
other possibilities that allow naturalness.  Or to phrase this in a
more challenging manner are there ways to constrain the naturalness of
these models that do not rely upon assumptions about how SUSY is
broken?

We have investigated this question here in the context of the MSSM and
U(1) extensions.  Since the RG evolution links the soft masses
together and causes these problems from stop and gluino masses the
most conservative approach to placing naturalness limits is to choose
a low cutoff. We find that in the MSSM the most direct way to
constrain naturalness of the model, without making assumptions about
the SUSY breaking scale is through limits on the chargino
masses. Current LHC limits on charginos are not model independent and
thereby leave many gaps where on can have light charginos.

In contrast we find that in $U(1)$ extensions of the MSSM there is an
additional way to constrain the naturalness of the models, which is
through the $Z^\prime$ mass limit.  We find when we impose a low
cutoff of $20$ TeV for setting the soft masses, the lowest tuning in
the E$_6$SSM is compatible with a $Z^\prime$ mass of $2.5$ TeV was
$\Delta \approx 100$, while if the LHC run II can place a limit of
$4.5$ TeV on $M_Z^\prime$ then the tuning would be just under $400$.
By comparison the current situation in the MSSM only requires a tuning
of around $20-30$. [Dylan: update numbers a bit -- I suck at reading
  them off the graphs:)] This should be interpreted as saying that in
the most conservative limits one can place on naturalness on these
models, the tuning in the E$_6$SSM is worse.  However if the chargino
limits blah blah blah then the situation in the two models would be
the same.

This should also be contrasted with what happens as we raise the
cutoff scale.  We showed that when the cutoff reaches $M_X =
[insert]$ the tuning of the MSSM becomes larger than that of the
E$_6$SSM.  Therefore the conclusion is not that one model is less
tuned than another, but rather that the answer depends on what
assumptions are made about the SUSY breaking.


Finally we also looked at the tuning in different $U(1)$ extensions for
fixed $\tan \beta = 10$.  We found that in all cases the fine tuning
was much worse for the larger $Z^\prime$ mass, further emphasising
the importance they play in these $U(1)$ extensions.  Interestingly
the actual level in tuning varied quite a bit between these models
with the $U(1)_I$ model showing the least tuning due to the vanishing
charge of the $H_u$ state. This model is quite interesting in the
sense that it provides a solution to the $\mu$-problem while avoiding
the large tuning (with current limits) from the $Z^\prime$
mass. However one should remember we are looking at conservative limits
on naturalness here and there is no solution to the usual tuning from
the large stops needed to get a $125$ GeV Higgs in this model.  In any
case future LHC limits on the $Z^\prime$ mass would be especially
interesting for this case as they would significantly raise the
minimum level of tuning which can be obtained.


 
% Our conclusions: at low scales stops are not a big contributor,
% Z' causes a significant fine tuning in the E6SSM (dominant -> lower
% bound), chargino bounds will be important for fine tuning in the MSSM
% but not as much for the E6SSM, and possibly discuss different U(1)' charges.

\section{\label{app:rges}RGE Contributions}
% List the derivatives needed in the Taylor series approximation
% to the RGE solutions.
Provided that one does not run over too large a range of scales, the
solutions to the RG equations for a model can be reasonably well
approximated by a Taylor series, Eq. (\ref{eq:rgeapproxsoln}).  For a
parameter $p$, this reads
\begin{equation*}
q(Q)=q(M_X)+\frac{t}{16\pi^2}\left ( \beta_q^{(1)}+\frac{\beta_q^{(2)}}{16\pi^2}\right )+\frac{t^2}{(16\pi^2)^2}b_q^{(2)}(M_X),
\end{equation*}
where we have for convenience defined
\begin{equation*}
b_q^{(2)}(M_X)=\frac{1}{2!}\left . \sum_{q_k}\beta_{q_k}^{(1)}\frac{\partial \beta_q}{\partial q_k}\right |_{M_X}.
\end{equation*}
We have constructed the necessary series solutions in both the MSSM
and the $U(1)$ extended models. Due to the smallness of the first and
second generation Yukawa couplings, we neglect them in our
calculations. The corresponding soft SUSY breaking trilinears are
likewise omitted. Additionally, all soft mass matrices are assumed
diagonal, and the gaugino masses are taken to be real.\\ \\ In the
MSSM, the relevant parameters for the fine tuning calculation are
$\mu$, $B$, $m_{H_u}^2$, $m_{H_d}^2$ at tree level. The one- and
two-loop RGEs for these parameters may be found in
\cite{Martin:1993zk}. The corresponding $O(t^2)$ contributions are

In these expressions the quantity $\mathcal{S}$ is defined by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:MSSMgaugeBetaContribution}
\mathcal{S}=m_{H_u}^2-m_{H_d}^2+\sum_{i=1}^3\left ( m_{Qi}^2-m_{Li}^2-2m_{ui}^2+m_{di}^2+m_{ei}^2\right ).
\end{equation}
If in addition the one-loop contributions to the effective potential
from top and stop loops are included, it is also necessary to
construct the expansions for $m_{Q3}^2$, $m_{u3}^2$ and $A_t$. The
coefficients read

Similarly we can obtain the two-loop $\beta$ functions and
coefficients $b_p^{(2)}$ for a general set of $U(1)'$
charges. Two-loop RGEs for the gauge and Yukawa couplings, gaugino
masses and soft trilinears, along with the one-loop RGEs for the soft
scalar masses, were given in \cite{Athron:2009bs} for the particular
case of the E$_6$SSM. At tree level in the EWSB conditions the
parameters that must be considered are $\lambda$, $A_\lambda$,
$m_{H_u}^2$, $m_{H_d}^2$, $m_S^2$ and $g_1$, $g_2$ and $g_1'$. The
one- and two-loop contributions to the $\beta$ function for $\lambda$
are
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:USSMLambdaBetas}
\begin{align}
\beta_\lambda^{(1)}&=\lambda  \left[2\lambda ^2+2 \Sigma_\lambda +3 \Sigma_\kappa +3 y_t^2+3 y_b^2+y_{\tau }^2-3 g_2^2-\frac{3}{5} g_1^2 -2 \left ( \tilde{Q}_1^2 + \tilde{Q}_2^2 + \tilde{Q}_S^2\right )g_1'^2 \right],\label{eq:USSMLambdaBetaOneLoop}\\
\beta_\lambda^{(2)}&=\lambda \bigg \{ -2\lambda^2\left ( \lambda^2+2\Sigma_\lambda+3\Sigma_\kappa\right )-4\Pi_\lambda-6\Pi_\kappa-3\lambda^2\left ( 3y_t^2+3y_b^2+y_\tau^2\right ) \nonumber\\

\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where
\begin{equation*}
\Sigma_\lambda=\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2, \qquad \Sigma_\kappa=\kappa_1^2+\kappa_2^2+\kappa_3^2.
\end{equation*}
Additionally, in order to keep our expressions compact we also use the notation
\begin{align*}
\Sigma_{\tilde{Q}}=\sum_i \tilde{Q}_i^2, \qquad \Pi_{\tilde{Q}}=\sum_i \tilde{Q}_i^4
\end{align*}
to denote sums over the $U(1)'$ charges, and
\begin{align*}
\Sigma_{\tilde{Q}}^Y&=\sum_i \sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}Q_i^Y\tilde{Q}_i\\
&=-3\tilde{Q}_1+3\tilde{Q}_2+3\tilde{Q}_d-3\tilde{Q}_D+3\tilde{Q}_e-3\tilde{Q}_L+3\tilde{Q}_Q-6\tilde{Q}_u+3\tilde{Q}_{\overline{D}}+\tilde{Q}_{\overline{H'}}-\tilde{Q}_{H'}.
\end{align*}
Note that in these expressions the $U(1)_Y$ and $U(1)'$ charges are assumed to be GUT-normalised.
